# Rwards

The `Rwards` package is designed to transform the experience of learning R by turning errors into opportunities for growth and engagement. By rewarding users for making mistakes, this package aims to reduce the anxiety often associated with error messages and fosters a positive learning environment for newcomers. Users earn points or badges for each error encountered, encouraging exploration and experimentation without fear of failure. With built-in tips and helpful resources for troubleshooting common issues, `Rwards` empowers users to learn from their mistakes in a supportive and fun way.
